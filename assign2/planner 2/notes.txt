Used value iteration method.

The set of equations to solve:
V(S) = T(S,a,S')[R(S,a,S')+gamma*V(S')] , for all S.

I initialized all the RHS to some guessed value, to estimate the LHS.
The new V(S) values are then plugged back in the RHS, to update the new 
V(S) values. This process is repeated until the difference between old V(S)
and new V(S) values falls below a minimum threshold.
